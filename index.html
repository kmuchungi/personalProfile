            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
            I completed a degree in Computer Science at Africa Nazarene University (ANU) (Nairobi, Kenya) 
            in the graduating class of 2001.  After which point I had the privilege of working for ANU in the Registrar's 
            Office as an Administrative Assistant with the responsibility of managing the registration system.  
            After a few years I had opportunity to pursue Post Graduate studies at Humber College 
            (Toronto, Canada) for two years; The first year as a student and the second as an Intern with 
            The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) as a Test Analyst with their Internet Channel Delivery, 
            Quality Assurance, eChannels Department.
            </p><p>
            On completion of my two years, I joined the University of Surrey as a MSc Information Systems student.  
            It was here I realized my passion for research and applied to pursue doctoral studies with the Computing Department.  
            The Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences (FEPS) at the University of Surrey gives out two scholarships 
            every year and I was privileged to be one of the recipients in the academic year 2010-2011.

            My doctoral research is in the field of computational neuroscience and primarily involves computational 
            representation of visual processing within the retina, whilst simulating involvement of retina lateral neurons 
            and allowing the convergence of Rod and Cone systems for the purpose of informing the design and development of 
            retinal prosthesis.

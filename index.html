            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
            I completed a degree in Computer Science at Africa Nazarene University (ANU) (Nairobi, Kenya).  
            After which point I had the privilege of working for ANU in the Registrar's 
            Office as an Administrative Assistant with the responsibility of managing the registration system.  
            After a few years the opportunity to pursue Post Graduate studies at Humber College 
            (Toronto, Canada) for two years arose; The first year as a student and the second as an Intern with 
            The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) as a Test Analyst with their Internet Channel Delivery, 
            Quality Assurance, eChannels Department.
            </p><p>
            On completion of my two years, I joined the University of Surrey as a MSc Information Systems student.  
            It was here I realized my passion for research and applied to pursue doctoral studies with the Computing Department.  
            The Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences (FEPS) at the University of Surrey gives out two scholarships 
            every year and I was privileged to be one of the recipients in the academic year 2010-2011.
            </p>
            <p>
            My doctoral research is in the field of computational neuroscience and primarily involves computational 
            representation of visual processing within the retina, whilst simulating involvement of retina lateral neurons 
            and allowing the convergence of Rod and Cone systems for the purpose of informing the design and development of 
            retinal prosthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
            At ANU there was a strong emphasis on participating in and growing community, and this has been 
            something I’ve carried with me to this day.  It therefore follows that my journey to date has seen 
            me be involved in, such as to support the development of ‘the person’.  
            Below is a list charities and organizations I’ve volunteered at or contributed to:
